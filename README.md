## 1) Overview

This Repo contains the Streamlit app related to a climate change twitter sentiment analysis project located here ----> https://github.com/jonnybegreat/Team_6_CPT 

#### 2) What is Streamlit?

In its own words:
> Streamlit ... is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours!  All in pure Python. All for free.

> Itâ€™s a simple and powerful app model that lets you build rich UIs incredibly quickly.

Streamlit takes away much of the background work needed in order to get a platform which can deploy your models to clients and end users. Meaning that you get to focus on the important stuff (related to the data), and can largely ignore the rest. This will allow you to become a lot more productive.
